# ROS2 Exercises ‚Äì Week 1 & Week 2

This repo contains my ROS2 lab work for **Week 1** and **Week 2** done as part of my course.

## üß© [Week 1 ‚Äì Temperature Sensor & Monitor](./week1_exercise)

In this exercise, I created:
- A **temperature sensor node** that publishes random temperature values.  
- A **monitor node** that subscribes to the sensor and prints the readings.  
- A **monitor counter node** that counts the received messages.  
All nodes were launched using a single launch file.  
The project was built and run using `colcon build` and `ros2 run`.

## üìö [Week 2 ‚Äì Book Lookup Service](./week2_exercise)

This exercise focused on **ROS2 services**:
- A **Book Server** node that provides book lookup info (title ‚Üí location).  
- A **Book Client** node that requests data from the server.  
- An **Extended Server** version that allows partial or fuzzy matches.  
- Both were tested using ROS2 launch files and service calls.
